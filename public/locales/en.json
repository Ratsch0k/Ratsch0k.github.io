Over the years my main interest became cybersecurity, especially web security and network security, but I also very much continue to enjoy software development. I programmed my fair share of programs and websites over the years and I'm always eager to learn the next framework or language. From machine learning to game engines, I've tried many subjects. I've learned the following programming languages (decreasing level of expertise): <br/><br/>You can view my projects on the next page. <br/><br/>While I enjoy working alone in my own pace, I also like to work in motivated groups and I'm not shy to take over the leadership role if no one is up for it. <br/>I hope my achievements will interest you"
